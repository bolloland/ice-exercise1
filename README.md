Exercise

Directions: The workflow to follow should be to test out any DOM methods/manipulation in the browsers console. Once a solution has been found to work, copy and paste the code into the index.js file. Don't forget to load any JS files you are using inside of a script tag at the bottom of the index.html file. Have fun! 

Create a js project
Add a src folder
Create an index.js file in the src folder. This will be where your dom manipulation code will exist
Add an index.html, this file should be populated with a basic HTML doc structure
Create two separate divs inside index.html, these should not be nested, they should be sibling elements
The first div will have an id of title
Inside the div create an h1 tag with the text 'title goes here'
The second div will have a class of 'memes-container'

JAVASCRIPT TIME: Select the first div and change the h1 text to 'Programming Memes'
JAVASCRIPT TIME:  Create a paragraph element and append it to div#title
JAVASCRIPT TIME:  Select the newly made paragraph and add the following text "This is a page with fun programming memes

Create a file inside the src folder, memes.js and add the following:
const memes = [
